&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-an-app-for-robust-visualization-of-ecological-status-and-change-in-a-region&quot;&gt;Building an App for Robust Visualization of Ecological Status and Change in a Region&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ecological status plays an important role in defining the functioning of an ecosystem pertaining to a region. The variation in the structure of ecosystem could be a result of subsequent events happening over a time-period or due to a particular phenomenon at a time instant. There are methods in practice to understand these variations based on &lt;strong&gt;remote-sensing observations&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;in-situ measurements&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;manual surveys&lt;/strong&gt;. When it comes to in-situ measurements or manual surveys, a lot of resources and manual labor is required to complete the procedure. On the other hand, understanding variations in parameters affecting a regional ecosystem via remote-sensing based datasets such as satellite images, airborne sensor images requires relatively lesser amount of manual labor and could provide better insights over a large geographical scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, the questions which arises in front of us are - &lt;em&gt;What are the parameters which directly affect the ecological status of a region?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;What are the physical factors which influences the ecosystem?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Does these factors have same effect for different types of ecosystem?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;How can we make use of the large database of spatial and temporal data to generate insights about the ecological status of a region?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/summerofearthengine/home&quot;&gt;Google Summer of Earth Engine&lt;/a&gt; is an amazing initiative started by Google for supporting research along with leading Indian research organizations working in &lt;strong&gt;environment&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;conservation&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;water resources&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;agricultural domains&lt;/strong&gt;. In Google Summer of Earth Engine 2019, I have been selected to work with &lt;a href=&quot;http://ncf-india.org/&quot;&gt;Nature Conservation Foundation&lt;/a&gt; under the mentorship of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore_Doreswamy_Madhusudan&quot;&gt;Dr M D Madhusudan&lt;/a&gt;. Dr Madhusudan is an Indian wildlife biologist and ecologist and the Co-founder and Director of Nature Conservation Foundation. The NCF is actively working towards conservation of Indiaâ€™s unique wildlife heritage with innovative technological research and imaginative solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, addressing the questions raised above, it has been observed that satellite images provide us with a lot of information which could be used to understand the ecological status in a region. In the recent research, a lot of improvements has been done in defining the proxies on the satellite images which plays a significant role in defining the variation in real-world. One such example is of urbanisation. The satellite derived products and indices can show the existing settlement and built-up areas in a region. It is worth noting here that this information would provide spatial context. We can use the archives of such products to understand the temporal context over a period of years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/earthEngine.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;GEEApp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Earth Engine provides an end-to-end platform comprising of an inventory of datasets, algorithms for processing the datasets for specific applications and several other functionalities. The most important part is that Google Earth Engine provides the implementation of algorithms even for large geographical regions which corresponds to huge computation. Moreover, with the availability of UI features, it is also possible to wrap the implementation in the form of Earth Engine Apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our app, we are making complete use of the above-mentioned superb facilities provided by the Google Earth Engine platform. The app comprises of 2 modules - Frontend module and Backend module. The frontend module would comprise of the UI features and would pass the input options selected by the user to the backend module. The backend module would complete the processing and generate results. These results would again be passed to the frontend module to display on the app. The fun lies in the fact that all of these steps would be happening in the Google Earth Engine platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/soee_workflow.png&quot; alt=&quot;Workflow of Google Earth Engine App&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, we are approaching towards the completion of the project. In the following posts, I would be adding more details about the Google Earth Engine platform, my experience of working in Summer of Earth Engine 2019 and obviously, the application which we are developing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Till then, Keep reading! ðŸ˜Š&lt;/p&gt;

For the first time, I came across the computer in 2005-06. Yes, when I was 10. I was in the fifth standard and our computer teacher was explaining the students about the tangible parts of the computer. The Keyboard, the mouse, the monitor... And now, after 11 years, this machine has become a significant part of my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, you must be thinking why I am including this in my post. So, I would like to help you. This post is dedicated to &lt;a href=&quot;https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google Summer of Code 2017&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://mapmint.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MapMint&lt;/a&gt;. I would be sharing the details of my proposal, information about my organization, some details of my work and my enticing experience of GSoC 2017 Phase 1. Cool! Isn't it? Let's start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;Add Audio, Video and SOS input support in the MapMint4ME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - This is the title of my project. My mentoring organization is MapMint which comes under the umbrella organization &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.osgeo.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;OSGeo&lt;/a&gt;. What do I mean by umbrella organization? ðŸ˜• So, under one umbrella organization, there are several different &lt;a href=&quot;https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/?sp-page=5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;organizations&lt;/a&gt;. For example, MapMint, pgRouting, and istSOS all come under OSGeo. Also, for each project, the students find an angel in the mentors. The mentors not only help you in understanding the project but they also provide directions whenever you are not able to move forward. I found my angels in Mr. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/User:Djay&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GÃ©rald Fenoy&lt;/a&gt;, Mr. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Milan_Antonovic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Milan Antonovic&lt;/a&gt;, and Mr. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Sittichai_choosumrong&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sittichai Choosumrong&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to the mentors,&amp;nbsp;the developer mailing lists of the organizations are also very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;About MapMint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;MapMint is a web-based Geographic Information System (GIS). A GIS helps in storing, capturing, modifying and publishing the spatial or geographic data. So the question arises, how to store the geographical data. The geographical or spatial (involving space) data is stored in the fundamental units of &lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;points&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;line&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;polygon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Yes, you are correct if you sorted out that this is how Zomato recommends you&amp;nbsp;the closest restaurant to your location. The buildings, trees, electricity poles are stored as point objects. The lineaments or geographical objects having linear structure are stored as line objects in the database. A region representing area is stored in the database in the form of a polygon. So, when you search for nearby restaurants, the closest point on the basis of a buffer (distance) is queried in the database. The resulting outputs from the backend are&amp;nbsp;published on the screen. While this is the bigger picture, there are still more concepts involved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A GIS helps in facilitating the deployment of an infrastructure, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_data_infrastructure&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Spatial Data Infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;b style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;SDI&lt;/b&gt;). An SDI combines geographic data, metadata, the users, tools in an interactive&amp;nbsp;manner in a framework so that the spatial information can be used in an efficient and flexible manner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;MapMint amalgamates the capabilities of different software in a complete and coherent web mapping platform. At the heart of MapMint, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zoo-project.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ZOO-project&lt;/a&gt; is available. The ZOO-project is capable of deploying &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Processing_Service&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Web Processing Services&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(WPS), efficiently and easily. It is an SDI manager, which provides users' with the capability of designing their own map and web applications using MapServer. The other important software involved is &lt;a href=&quot;http://mapserver.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MapServer&lt;/a&gt;. The MapServer gives the capabilities of visualization and publication of spatial data (&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Web Map Service&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), access to image data (&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Web Coverage Service&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), and access to geographic data in vector format (&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Web Feature Service&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;).

It is the android application extending the functioning of MapMint to the mobile interface. The application is capable of recording the field data without internet connectivity. The current version provides the users, the flexibility and capability of storing all kind of alpha-numeric data. So, if you have MapMint4ME installed on your cell phone, you can capture images to record your position and view that position on a map, and that too without internet. Obviously, this all depends on the configuration settings selected by you from&amp;nbsp;your local MapMint server. As soon as you return to a place with internet connectivity, the field data can be recorded to the MapServer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With GSoC 2017, we plan to add new data type support for the field data collection. A user can also update audio and video recordings to the server database. Also, the aim is to include the capability to record sensor data. The sensor data will be obtained from the sensors embedded on the platform. This facility is termed as &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor_Observation_Service&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sensor Observation Service&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;SOS&lt;/span&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for a researcher who is departing for collecting data for the project, MapMint4ME can be a savior. The MapMint installation procedure, details of the modules present in it for publishing apps &lt;i&gt;et cetera &lt;/i&gt;is very well explained in the official website of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mapmint.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MapMint&lt;/a&gt;. More information can also be obtained by going through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mapmint.github.io/userguide-fr/en/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;User Guide&lt;/a&gt;. I will be posting the installation procedure and the method to publish data and tables using MapMint in upcoming blogs. So, keep visiting! ðŸ˜‰&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be sharing my weekly experience on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GSoC_17:_Add_Audio,_Video_and_SOS_input_support_in_MapMint4ME&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wiki&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;br /&gt;You can also find my &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U_yLzNtNSehUr0o_26QenOFzEY2Rk1DypPrtrpvUUQY/edit?usp=sharing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;About GSoC Phase 1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The experience till now is very unique in itself. The thrilling feel to be a part of something which is a contribution to open-source development is genuine and I am enjoying that feeling. Though sometimes, the plan does not work the way we want it to, but after some discussion and analysis, a solution is usually obtained. Google Summer of Code provides an opportunity to interact with developers and contributors around the world.

The above excerpt is a part of the&amp;nbsp;conversation between my elder brother and me. It was the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i class=&quot;&quot;&gt;xx&lt;/i&gt;th day of September&amp;nbsp;2008 and I was 13. Yeah, you guessed it right. We both were super excited to welcome each and every part of our 1st personal computer, a desktop, which was assembled in front of us. Each time a new part arrived, we used to follow it from the road outside to its desk. Obviously, I applied the basics faster and installed half a dozen game the first night. But, I lost to my brother as he knew how to secure the system with the password. Within few days, we both collaborated and enjoyed our days. This was the time when I came to know about Windows. For sure, the word operating system came much later and Shell even after that. The dial moved further, we both graduated. Now, we both have our own personal computer. But, as is quoted in the movie &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Figures&quot;&gt;Hidden Figures&lt;/a&gt;:&quot; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The first one matters the most&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;georgia&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot; , serif; font-size: large;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;georgia&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot; , serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-family: &amp;quot;georgia&amp;quot; , &amp;quot;times new roman&amp;quot; , serif;&quot;&gt;Now, who in the world is 'Tux'? Actually, it is /-Tuk-/. Tux is the mascot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.linux.org/&quot;&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;. Linux is the best- known and most-used &lt;a href=&quot;https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source&quot;&gt;open source&lt;/a&gt; operating system. The most splendid thing which I like about open source software&amp;nbsp;is its community support. So, if you pursue an enthusiasm to try and check out some code available and you get stuck in middle, then don't worry, someone like you from the open source community will definitely help you out. In the meantime, starting with Windows XP then Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and ultimately Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, this journey is very interesting. Recently, I switched to Kubuntu which is the KDE flavor of typical Ubuntu. In short, you can refer to the&amp;nbsp;following link to understand the differences between Kubuntu and Ubuntu.

As a part of a project, Mr.Ankur Shukla and I got a chance to present our work- SPark&amp;nbsp;in the FOSS4G-Asia 2017 conference. This conference was held in International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad, India. SPark is still in development phase. It is a smart parking web app which will assist you to the nearest available parking space to your destination.
